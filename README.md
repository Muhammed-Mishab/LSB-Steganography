# LSB-Steganography
Developed an image-based steganography system using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to hide encrypted text data within RGB images. The system preserves image quality while enabling accurate data extraction, demonstrating secure communication, bit-level manipulation, and low-level data processing.
